## Generating a tree according to the CRP-TREE model

Set your own values of $N, B, \alpha$. We generate $\tilde{T}^{\ell}_{N,B}$ with $N=30, B=10, \alpha=2$.

```{r}
N <- 30
B <- 10
alpha <- 2
tree_ex <- rcrp_tree(N, B, alpha)

```

We can plot the tree with and without internal node labels. 
 
```{r}
plot_crp_tree(tree_ex)
plot_crp_tree(tree_ex, TRUE)
```

Next, we can calculate the probability of observing $\tilde{T}^{\ell}_{N,B}$ under various values of $\alpha$. 

```{r}
pcrp_tree(tree_ex, 1)
pcrp_tree(tree_ex, 2)
pcrp_tree(tree_ex, 5)

```

In addition, we can calculate the conditional probability of observing $T^{\ell}_{N,B}$ given the tree shape $T_N$ under our initial null model.

```{r}
pnull_tree(tree_ex)
```

Once we have the tree, we can calculate the number of same attachments $S$. 

```{r}
count_same_attachments(tree_ex)
```

If we had a tree that was not planar, then we can average out the planarity by calculating the mean number of same attachments. We do so via Monte Carlo approximation and specifying the number of planar permutations. 

```{r}
s_0 <- compute_S_mean(tree_ex, 500)
s_0
```

### Processing trees 
If provided with a phylogenetic tree, it must be in Newick format with tip labels $(-1, -2)$, have isochronous tips, and have no tied internal nodes. You would use \texttt{process\_tree} to modifys any tree into the desired form. The tip labels can be specified directly (ie only two possible tip labels). The argument \texttt{term} is used to change tip labels to $(-1,-2)$ given that each tip label either contains or does not contain the term. The data frame \texttt{tip\_corresponding} can also be provided as the category of each tip label. If neither argument is given, then the tree is returned with its original tip labels. 

## Testing on fixed phylogenetic trees. 

For ranked, partially labeled, non-planar trees $T^{\ell}_{N,B}$, we have two methods of testing.

### Fixing the ranked tree shape
The first method measures how extreme $S$ is conditioned on a ranked tree shape $T_N$. The null distribution is the distribution of $S$ over the space of all ranked, partially labeled, planar trees $\tilde{T}^{\ell}_{N,B}$ that are compatible with $T_N$. The observed distribution is the distribution of $S$ over the planar representations of the given $T^{\ell}_{N,B}$. Then for each observed $S$, we calculate a p-value, and define the \textbf{tree shape conditioned p-value} $p_T$ to be the average of all such p-values. 

```{r}
S_obs <- simulate_S_observed(tree_ex, 50)
S_mean <- mean(S_obs)

S_tree_null <- simulate_S_tree_null(tree_ex, 50)
pval_tree <- mean(rbind(outer(S_tree_null, S_obs, '>='), rep(TRUE, length(S_obs))))

ggplot(as.data.frame(S_tree_null), aes(S_tree_null)) + geom_bar(color='black', fill='gray') + theme_light()+ xlab('S') + ggtitle('Approximate null distribution of S conditional on T_N')
  
```

### Using $\hat{S_0}$ by averaging over planar representations

The second method simulates a null distribution of $\hat{S_0}$ by relabeling the given ranked tree shape and computing $\hat{S_0}$ for each relabeling. Then we compute $\bar{p}_S$, the average $S$ p-value using the observed value of $\hat{S_0}$.

```{r}
S_mean_null <- simulate_S_mean_tree(tree_ex, 50, 49)
pval_avg <- (1+ sum(S_mean_null >= S_mean))/(1+length(S_mean_null))

ggplot(as.data.frame(S_mean_null), aes(S_mean_null)) + 
  geom_histogram(color='black', fill='gray', bins=20) + theme_light()+
  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(floor(min(S_mean_null)), ceiling(max(c(max(S_mean_null), S_mean))))) +
  geom_vline(xintercept=S_mean, color='red') + xlab('S_0') + 
  ggtitle('Approximate null distribution of S_0, Red line is observed value')
```

There is a function if you just want the observed $\hat{S_0}$ for the partially labeled ranked tree shape, and the two p-values. There are additional parameters so that the null distributions and observed $S$ distributions can be saved for future use. 

```{r}
one_tree_all_methods(tree_ex, 50, 49, 49)
```

We can also compare to three other existing methods by specifying additional arguments.
```{r}
one_tree_all_methods(tree_ex, 50, 49, 49, alt_methods = TRUE)
```

### Power analysis
If you would to do a power analysis for a given ranked tree shape and an $\alpha$ value, we would need to sample under the alternative. The following function directly allows you to do so. More interested users can look at the code for further detail. The number of samples can be set to however many needed, but 60\% seems to be the acceptance rate for the planar sampling, while the relabeling step is around 50\% but varies quite a bit from run to run. The significance level is default set to 0.05. 


```{r}
alphas <- c(2,20)
crp_tree_power(tree_ex, alphas, num_sample= 50, num_pl=50, nperm_null = 30, nperm_labels=30)
```

## Fixed Tree Computations

### Counting partial labels
Fix any ranked tree shape $T_N$ and $B$. We want to count the number of ranked, partially labeled representations (i.e. $T^{\ell}_{N,B}$) of $T_N$. Let's try it out on our example tree from above, which has 30 tips and 10 blue tips: there are more than 2 million possible labelings. 

```{r}
count_partial_labels(tree_ex, 10)
```

We can also count the total number of ranked, partially labeled tree shapes for a specific $N,B$. This number grows very fast, so be weary when running. For example, when $N=8, B=4$, there are 7428 possibilities.

```{r}
count_ranked_pl_trees(8,4)
```


### Moments
Given values for $N,B,\alpha$, we can calculate the expected value of $S$ under the CRP-TREE model. Taking the parameters we used to generate \texttt{tree_ex}. With $\alpha=2$, the expected value is approximately 18.92, while our observed value was 21.136. Under $\alpha=1$, the expected value is lower at 15.126. 

```{r}
expected_value_function(30, 10, 2)

expected_value_function(30, 10, 1)
```

### Maximum Likelihood
If you have a planar, partially labeled ranked tree shape, or a list of independent such trees (with the same $N,B$), then you can calculate the MLE $\hat{\alpha}^{MLE}$.  

```{r}
get_mle_1tree(tree_ex)$maximum

tree_ex_2 <- rcrp_tree(N, B, alpha)
get_mle_trees(list(tree_ex, tree_ex_2))$maximum
```

Likelihood ratio tests for $H_0:\alpha=1$ vs $H_1 : \alpha>1$. 

```{r}
lrt_1tree(tree_ex)

lrt_many_trees(list(tree_ex, tree_ex_2))
```
